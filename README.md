# PNG encoder and decoder

This tool can encode a message into a PNG image by modifying the Red Channel.

This tool is written in rustðŸ¦€!!!!

You can use the help command to see all the availble commands and details about them in the terminal.

> Note : You can use the exe file after generating it, until that we can stick with `cargo run --` after which we can pass the arguments just like we would pass it to the final executable.

```
cargo run -- help
```

The output is shown below
